## Usage

To run project tests, open project in IntelliJ, right click 'Main' in `src/main/Main` and click 'run'.

Tests 1 - 4 are defined in individual functions in the `ElevatorTestDriver`.  By default, the tests will run in sequential order without stopping.  Test function calls can also be commented out in order to run a specific test by itself.
